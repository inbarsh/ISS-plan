# ISS-plan
The International Space Station (ISS) is an orbital outpost circling high above our heads. We want to know when the ISS is planned to fly over Israelâ€™s largest cities, and store this information in a database.

Run following in your terminal (after changing your present working directory to the location where the following file is located) if you have python3 installed on your machine:
```
python iss_plan.py 
```
or
```
python3 iss_plan.py
```
